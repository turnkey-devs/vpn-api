/**
 * Deepmerge vs deep-merge/deep-extend
 * MERGING DEFAULT VAL BEHAVIOR
 * deepmerge => will leave default / prev obj value if the target obj is null / undefined
 * deep-merge/deep-extend => will replace all value on default obj to target obj
 * MERGING PROPERTIES
 * deepmerge : 
		- has option to replace array or customize it
		- wont clone literal type (example: abstract class, entities), object created from merge will be pure object value. 
 * deep-merge/deep-extend :
		- only replace
		- will clone literal type (example: abstract class, entities), safe for merging entities.
 * solution: TESTED ðŸ§ª deepmerge-ts, will do as our needs, wont replace to undefined, will clone types
